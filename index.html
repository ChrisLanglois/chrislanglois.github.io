    <p>Things can be large in size but meaningless. Other things can be ultra-wee (in size) but quite important. This website could be called Minor/Mega as well, or Mega/Minor, Minor/Mega…or Minor/Mega, Mega/Minor…but it's not called those things, a name had to be chosen, and this was it. Not a big deal. Sort of a Minor/Minor. Really the title here is a starting point that can lead to many Mega or Minor combinations. So it will suffice. What will be shown here? Images depicting current M/M items/places/thoughts. Is that it? Nah.....maybe...?</p>
